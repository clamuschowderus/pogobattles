# pogobattles
pokebattler simulations generator. 

Many, many thanks to reddit user celandro. I downloaded his code and incorporated into my own GAME_MASTER parser.

Two main methods to run: pogobattles.Main.main() for simulations or pogobattles.PrintMain.main() to print out GAME_MASTER information.

Adjust BASE_FOLDER value to resource folder location in both pogobattles.Main and pogobattles.PrintMain

Play with the parameters in pogobattles.Main to get different results.

Sorry for the overall horrible quality of the code. I vomited this code in record time.
